# FastAPI-ML-service

A production-oriented FastAPI backend for building and deploying machine learning–powered APIs with clean architecture, database integration, and scalable design practices.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and implement RESTful APIs using FastAPI, integrate relational databases, and serve trained machine learning models through well-structured endpoints.

The focus is on writing clean, maintainable backend code that follows industry best practices.

## Features Implemented
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Request and response validation using Pydantic
- Modular FastAPI application structure
- Database integration using SQLAlchemy (CRUD operations)
- Machine learning model loading and inference via API endpoints

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- Python
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL
- Scikit-learn / Keras
- Uvicorn

## Project Status
🚧 Work in progress  
Upcoming improvements include authentication, performance optimization, and deployment enhancements.
